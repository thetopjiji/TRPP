# TRPP
- The benchmark.zip consists of 140 instances which can be grouped into 7 sets: n=10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000. 
- The first 6 sets are proposed by Dewilde et al. [1] based on graphs from TSPLIB.  These six sets of instances are obtained by the email from the authors.
- The last set (n=1000) is proposed by Pei et al. [2], which can be downloaded from http://www.mi.sanu.ac.rs/~nenad/trpp/
